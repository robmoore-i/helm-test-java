# Helm Test Java

A library for writing automated tests for Helm charts.

TODO:
- The Helm Test Java library should use the system property set up by the plugin for the default
HelmExecutor constructor.
- The HelmExecutor should render Helm templates and errors.
- The example project should have a Helm chart which demonstrates use of the library.
